# Android-Learning
Going through the Android Development Book to learn how to build mobile applications on Android. 

This project is only meant to be a reference point for application development questions I, or people I work with, may have. Also it can be a way to track my learning progress. 

The book i'm following can be found here: https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/android-programming-bryan-sills/1142713380?ean=9780137645541
I understand that this is just the 5th edition and at some point there will be a newer/more updated book. This is not meant to be updated as time progresses. It is simply just a means to track current progress and give others a way to understand, step by step, how to create projects in Android and eventually deploy them on the app store. 

[forums.bignerdranch.com](https://forums.bignerdranch.com/) will be a forum for updates on how things changed when it comes to building/creating these projects.
